    The Disappearance

Description: A fellow member of the Black Castle, Sir Roderick, has not returned from his patrol in the forest. The castle is concerned, and Lucien is asked to venture into the forest to find him.
Gameplay: Lucien follows tracks and signs of struggle through the forest. Along the way, he encounters increasingly hostile creatures, hinting that something is disturbing the natural balance.
The Dark Secret

Description: As Lucien investigates, he discovers evidence of Sir Roderick's experimentation with monster blood. Old journals or notes reveal that Roderick believed ingesting the blood would give him the strength to defend the castle, but the blood instead cursed him.
Gameplay: Lucien finds a hidden campsite where Roderick conducted his experiments. Clues like discarded vials, bloodstained tools, and torn clothing lead Lucien to realize that Roderick has transformed into a werewolf.
The Hunt Begins

Description: Lucien tracks the werewolf deeper into the forest, discovering that the recent increase in monster attacks is due to Roderick’s transformation. Roderick, now consumed by his curse, has been leading the monsters in attacks against the castle and nearby villages.
Gameplay: This part of the quest involves tracking the werewolf through the forest, battling other creatures drawn to Roderick's newfound power. The tension builds as Lucien gets closer to confronting the werewolf.
The Confrontation

Description: Lucien finally confronts Roderick, now fully transformed into a powerful werewolf. Despite Roderick's bestial nature, there may be moments of lucidity where he pleads with Lucien to end his suffering.
Gameplay: This is a challenging boss fight where Lucien must defeat Roderick. The werewolf will have enhanced strength, speed, and regenerative abilities, making it a tough battle. Lucien might have the option to use silver weapons or other special items to weaken the werewolf.
The Aftermath

Description: After defeating the werewolf, Lucien returns to the Black Castle with the grim news. The castle members mourn the loss of Sir Roderick, but they are also relieved that the attacks will cease. This event might leave Lucien with a sense of guilt or questions about the dangers of power and the consequences of desperation.

    The Omen

Description: The Black Castle receives word from the castle’s scholars and seers that "The Long Night" is approaching—a rare event that occurs once every 100 years when the moon eclipses the sun, plunging the world into darkness. During this time, an ancient prophecy warns of a monstrous horde rising from the icy wilderness, intent on overwhelming the world of men.
Gameplay: Lucien and the castle’s inhabitants prepare for the impending assault. This stage involves fortifying the castle's defenses, gathering supplies, and boosting morale among the soldiers. There might also be smaller skirmishes or scouting missions to gather intelligence on the approaching threat.
The Darkness Descends

Description: As the eclipse begins, the temperature plummets, and darkness falls over the land. From the frozen forests and mountains, the monster horde emerges—an overwhelming force of ice wraiths, frost giants, and other winter-born creatures. The Black Castle's walls are the only thing standing between these creatures and the human lands beyond.
Gameplay: This stage involves defending the castle's walls and gates. Lucien and his fellow soldiers fight off wave after wave of monsters. The battle is chaotic, with Lucien having to move between different parts of the castle to reinforce defenses, assist wounded comrades, and repel the relentless assault.
The Commander’s Stand

Description: As the battle rages on, it becomes clear that the monsters are being driven by a powerful leader—a Frost Wyrm or an ancient Ice Lich. The castle’s commander, a seasoned warrior and tactician, leads a counteroffensive, rallying the soldiers and pushing back against the tide of monsters.
Gameplay: In this stage, Lucien fights alongside the commander in a series of critical battles. The commander provides strategic guidance and support, turning the tide of battle with his leadership. Lucien might be tasked with special missions during the fight, such as disabling siege weapons or taking down key enemy leaders.
The Final Push

Description: In a desperate final assault, the monster horde throws everything they have at the Black Castle. The battle reaches its peak as Lucien and the commander face the monstrous leader in a climactic showdown.
Gameplay: This is the final boss battle of the quest. Lucien, the commander, and the remaining soldiers must defeat the Frost Wyrm or Ice Lich leading the horde. The battle is intense, with the enemy using powerful ice-based magic and devastating attacks. Victory requires teamwork, quick reflexes, and strategic thinking.
The Dawn of Victory

Description: After the battle, the moon passes, and the sun slowly returns, bringing an end to "The Long Night." The monster horde is defeated, and the Black Castle stands victorious but battered. Lucien and his comrades are exhausted but alive, having defended the castle and the realm from certain destruction.
Gameplay: The aftermath involves tending to the wounded, mourning the fallen, and repairing the castle’s defenses. Lucien reflects on the battle and the sacrifices made. This stage also serves as a moment of character growth for Lucien, solidifying his resolve and preparing him for the challenges ahead.
The Summons

Description: A week after the battle, Lucien is summoned to the estate by his father. He is to attend a ceremony with the king, where he will be commended for his bravery and efforts in defending the realm. This event is both an honor and a reminder of the obligations that await him, setting the stage for the next arc.
Gameplay: Lucien travels to the estate, where he is greeted with respect and admiration. The ceremony is a formal affair, with the king and other nobles in attendance. Lucien might receive a special reward or title, but the experience also serves as a reminder of the weight of duty and the expectations placed upon him by his father and the kingdom.
